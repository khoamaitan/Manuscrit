	abstract="The Hough Transform is a well-known method for detecting parameterized objects. It is the de facto standard for detecting lines and circles in 2-dimensional data sets. For 3D it has attained little attention so far. Even for the 2D case high computational costs have lead to the development of numerous variations for the Hough Transform. In this article we evaluate different variants of the Hough Transform with respect to their applicability to detect planes in 3D point clouds reliably. Apart from computational costs, the main problem is the representation of the accumulator. Usual implementations favor geometrical objects with certain parameters due to uneven sampling of the parameter space. We present a novel approach to design the accumulator focusing on achieving the same size for each cell and compare it to existing designs.

	The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a
	set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points.
	Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For
	models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a
	representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even
	in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with
	respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data.
	Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute.
	Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include
	measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape
	classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.}

abstract = {Presents a road obstacle detection method able to cope with uphill and downhill gradients and dynamic pitching of the vehicle. Our approach is based on the construction and investigation of the "v-disparity" image which provides a good representation of the geometric content of the road scene. The advantage of this image is that it provides semi-global matching and is able to perform robust obstacle detection even in the case of partial occlusion or errors committed during the matching process. Furthermore, this detection is performed without any explicit extraction of coherent structures. This paper explains the construction of the "v-disparity" image, its main properties, and the obstacle detection method. The longitudinal profile of the road is estimated and the objects located above the road surface are then extracted as potential obstacles; subsequently, the accurate detection of road obstacles, in particular the position of tyre-road contact points is computed in a precise manner. The whole process is performed at frame rate with a current-day PC. Our experimental findings and comparisons with the results obtained using a flat geometry hypothesis show the benefits of our approach.},

The initial selection of groups of coplanar points is performed on the basis of conservation of two five point projective invariants (groups for which this invariant is conserved are assumed to be coplanar). The correspondences for four of the five points are used to define a projectivity which is used to predict the change in position of other points assuming they lie on the same plane as the original four. A distance threshold between actual and predicted position is used to find extended planar regions. If two distinct planar regions can be found then a novel motion direction estimator suggests itself.",

In this paper, a brief review about state-of-art method for planar region detection is presented. All these methods are classified into three types, that is stereo-based, monocular-based and multi-sensor fusion based method according to the sensor they used. And the monocular-based method is further divided into three kinds, projection invariance, homography based and optical flow based method. For each kind of the method, the correspondent references and its main process are summarized. Finally, the challenges for plane detection with vision are presented in authors view. We hope that this paper can be a start point to probe deep insight in this field.",

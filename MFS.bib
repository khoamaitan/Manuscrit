	abstract="We have developed direct methods for recovering the motion of an observer in a static environment in the case of pure rotation, pure translation, and arbitrary motion when the rotation is known. Some of these methods are based on the minimization of the difference between the observed time derivative of brightness and that predicted from the spatial brightness gradient, given the estimated motion. We minimize the square of the integral of this difference taken over the image region of interest. Other methods presented here exploit the fact that surfaces have to be in front of the observer in order to be seen.",

	abstract="After [10,15,12,2,4] minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for energy minimization in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-style ``push-relabel' methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style augmenting paths. We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and interactive segmentation. In many cases our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods making near real-time performance possible.",

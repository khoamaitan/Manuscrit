	abstract = {Modern large displacement optical flow algorithms usually use an initialization by either sparse descriptor matching techniques or dense approximate nearest neighbor fields. While the latter have the advantage of being dense, they have the major disadvantage of being very outlier-prone as they are not designed to find the optical flow, but the visually most similar correspondence. In this article we present a dense correspondence field approach that is much less outlier-prone and thus much better suited for optical flow estimation than approximate nearest neighbor fields. Our approach does not require explicit regularization, smoothing (like median filtering) or a new data term. Instead we solely rely on patch matching techniques and a novel multi-scale matching strategy. We also present enhancements for outlier filtering. We show that our approach is better suited for large displacement optical flow estimation than modern descriptor matching techniques. We do so by initializing EpicFlow with our approach instead of their originally used state-of-the-art descriptor matching technique. We significantly outperform the original EpicFlow on MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and Middlebury. In this extended article of our former conference publication we further improve our approach in matching accuracy as well as runtime and present more experiments and insights.},

We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show show our technique can be adapted for use in a stereo vision system. 1. Introduction  Image registration finds a variety of applications in computer vision, such as image matching for stereo vision, pattern recognition, and motion analysis.

The vector d = [dx dy] T is the image velocity at x, also known as the optical flow at x. Because of the aperture problem, it is essential to define the notion of similarity in a 2D neighborhood sense. Let ωx and ωy two integers.

The authors start by formulating constraints on image motion to account for the possibility of multiple motions. This is achieved by exploiting the notions of weak continuity and robust statistics in the formulation of a minimization problem. The resulting objective function is non-convex. Traditional stochastic relaxation techniques for minimizing such functions prove inappropriate for the task. A highly parallel incremental stochastic minimization algorithm is presented which has a number of advantages over previous approaches. The incremental nature of the scheme makes it dynamic and permits the detection of occlusion and disocclusion boundaries},

	abstract = {Linear parameterized models of optical flow, particularly affine models, have become widespread in image motion analysis. The linear model coefficients are straightforward to estimate, and they provide reliable estimates of the optical flow of smooth surfaces. Here we explore the use of parameterized motion models that represent much more varied and complex motions. Our goals are threefold: to construct linear bases for complex motion phenomena; to estimate the coefficients of these linear models; and to recognize or classify image motions from the estimated coefficients. We consider two broad classes of motions: i) generic “motion features” such as motion discontinuities and moving bars; and ii) non-rigid, object-specific, motions such as the motion of human mouths. For motion features we construct a basis of steerable flow fields that approximate the motion features. For object-specific motions we construct basis flow fields from example motions using principal component analysis. In both cases, the model coefficients can be estimated directly from spatiotemporal image derivatives with a robust, multi-resolution scheme. Finally, we show how these model coefficients can be use to detect and recognize specific motions such as occlusion boundaries and facial expressions.},

	abstract = {Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a finite image region, only a single motion is present. Thissingle motion assumptionis violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences.},

Such an adaptive estimation lowers the level at which the resulting optic flow (OF) field is disturbed by noise and estimation artefacts. This in turn substantially simplifies the analysis of remaining — often subtle — effects which easily jeopardize a ‘naive’ segmentation approach. Appropriate treatment of such effects eventually results in a basically simple, but nevertheless surprisingly robust segmentation approach. Various stages of this approach are illustrated by examples for the extraction of moving vehicle images from a digitized road intersection video-sequence.},

By combining the three-dimensional (3D) structure tensor with a parametric flow model, the optical flow estimation problem is converted to a generalized eigenvalue problem. The optical flow can be accurately estimated from the generalized eigenvectors. The confidence measure derived from the generalized eigenvalues is used to adaptively adjust the coherent motion region to further improve the accuracy. Experiments using both synthetic sequences with ground truth and real sequences illustrate our method. Comparisons with classical and recently published methods are also given to demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm.},

Some of these methods are based on the minimization of the difference between the observed time derivative of brightness and that predicted from the spatial brightness gradient, given the estimated motion. We minimize the square of the integral of this difference taken over the image region of interest. Other methods presented here exploit the fact that surfaces have to be in front of the observer in order to be seen.",

	abstract = {Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a finite image region, only a single motion is present. Thissingle motion assumptionis violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences.},

So far, however, the application of such filters has been restricted to two-frame optical flow methods. In this paper, we go beyond this two-frame case and investigate the usefulness of such filtering steps for multi-frame optical flow estimation. Thereby we consider both the application to single flow fields as well as the filtering of the entire spatio-temporal flow volume. In this context, we propose the use of a joint trilateral filter that processes all flow fields simultaneously while imposing consistency of joint flow structures at the same time. Evaluations on the Middlebury benchmark clearly demonstrate the success of our filtering strategy. Achieving rank 3, our method yields state-of-the art results and significantly outperforms the baseline method providing considerably sharper results.},

	abstract = {In this paper we show that a classic optical flow technique by Nagel and Enkelmann (1986, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., Vol. 8, pp. 565–593) can be regarded as an early anisotropic diffusion method with a diffusion tensor. We introduce three improvements into the model formulation that (i) avoid inconsistencies caused by centering the brightness term and the smoothness term in different images, (ii) use a linear scale-space focusing strategy from coarse to fine scales for avoiding convergence to physically irrelevant local minima, and (iii) create an energy functional that is invariant under linear brightness changes. Applying a gradient descent method to the resulting energy functional leads to a system of diffusion–reaction equations. We prove that this system has a unique solution under realistic assumptions on the initial data, and we present an efficient linear implicit numerical scheme in detail. Our method creates flow fields with 100 \% density over the entire image domain, it is robust under a large range of parameter variations, and it can recover displacement fields that are far beyond the typical one-pixel limits which are characteristic for many differential methods for determining optical flow. We show that it performs better than the optical flow methods with 100 \% density that are evaluated by Barron et al. (1994, Int. J. Comput. Vision, Vol. 12, pp. 43–47).

The method estimates the depth and 3D motion field of a dynamic scene from multiple consecutive frames in a sliding temporal window, such that the estimate is consistent across both viewpoints of all frames within the window. The observed scene is modeled as a collection of planar patches that are consistent across views, each undergoing a rigid motion that is approximately constant over time. Finding the patches and their motions is cast as minimization of an energy function over the continuous plane and motion parameters and the discrete pixel-to-plane assignment. We show that such a view-consistent multi-frame scheme greatly improves scene flow computation in the presence of occlusions, and increases its robustness against adverse imaging conditions, such as specularities. Our method currently achieves leading performance on the KITTI benchmark, for both flow and stereo.",

	abstract="3D scene flow estimation aims to jointly recover dense geometry and 3D motion from stereoscopic image sequences, thus generalizes classical disparity and 2D optical flow estimation. To realize its conceptual benefits and overcome limitations of many existing methods, we propose to represent the dynamic scene as a collection of rigidly moving planes, into which the input images are segmented. Geometry and 3D motion are then jointly recovered alongside an over-segmentation of the scene. This piecewise rigid scene model is significantly more parsimonious than conventional pixel-based representations, yet retains the ability to represent real-world scenes with independent object motion. It, furthermore, enables us to define suitable scene priors, perform occlusion reasoning, and leverage discrete optimization schemes toward stable and accurate results. Assuming the rigid motion to persist approximately over time additionally enables us to incorporate multiple frames into the inference. To that end, each view holds its own representation, which is encouraged to be consistent across all other viewpoints and frames in a temporal window. We show that such a view-consistent multi-frame scheme significantly improves accuracy, especially in the presence of occlusions, and increases robustness against adverse imaging conditions.

	abstract="Confidence measures are crucial to the interpretation of any optical flow measurement. Even though numerous methods for estimating optical flow have been proposed over the last three decades, a sound, universal, and statistically motivated confidence measure for optical flow measurements is still missing. We aim at filling this gap with this contribution, where such a confidence measure is derived, using statistical test theory and measurable statistics of flow fields from the regarded domain. The new confidence measure is computed from merely the results of the optical flow estimator and hence can be applied to any optical flow estimation method, covering the range from local parametric to global variational approaches. Experimental results using state-of-the-art optical flow estimators and various test sequences demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique compared to existing 'confidence' measures.",

	abstract = {The quantitative evaluation of optical flow algorithms by Barron et al. (1994) led to significant advances in performance. The challenges for optical flow algorithms today go beyond the datasets and evaluation methods proposed in that paper. Instead, they center on problems associated with complex natural scenes, including nonrigid motion, real sensor noise, and motion discontinuities. We propose a new set of benchmarks and evaluation methods for the next generation of optical flow algorithms. To that end, we contribute four types of data to test different aspects of optical flow algorithms: (1) sequences with nonrigid motion where the ground-truth flow is determined by tracking hidden fluorescent texture, (2) realistic synthetic sequences, (3) high frame-rate video used to study interpolation error, and (4) modified stereo sequences of static scenes. In addition to the average angular error used by Barron et al., we compute the absolute flow endpoint error, measures for frame interpolation error, improved statistics, and results at motion discontinuities and in textureless regions. In October 2007, we published the performance of several well-known methods on a preliminary version of our data to establish the current state of the art. We also made the data freely available on the web at http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/. Subsequently a number of researchers have uploaded their results to our website and published papers using the data. A significant improvement in performance has already been achieved. In this paper we analyze the results obtained to date and draw a large number of conclusions from them.},

The theory is developed for the case when such orientation computations are necessary at all local neighborhoods of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Detection of orientation is shown to correspond to fitting an axis or a plane to the Fourier transform of an n-dimensional structure. The solution of this problem is related to the solution of a well-known matrix eigenvalue problem. The computations can be performed in the spatial domain without actually doing a Fourier transformation. Along with the orientation estimate, a certainty measure, based on the error of the fit, is proposed. Two applications in image analysis are considered: texture segmentation and optical flow. The theory is verified by experiments which confirm accurate orientation estimates and reliable certainty measures in the presence of noise. The comparative results indicate that the theory produces algorithms computing robust texture features as well as optical flow},

The proposed method is based on a differential neighborhood-sampling technique combined with a multi-scale approach and flow filtering techniques. The multi-scale approach is introduced to overcome the aliasing problem in the computation of spatial and temporal derivatives. The flow filtering is useful near motion boundaries to preserve discontinuities. A residual function, which is a confidence measure of the least-squares fit used to compute the optical flow, is introduced and used to filter the flow and to detect motion boundaries. These boundaries, that we call motion edges are extracted by searching for the directional maxima of the map obtained by thinning this residual function. The proposed method has been tested in a variety of conditions. The results obtained with test images show that the proposed approach is ...},

However, in real-life visual applications, such as tracking, activity detection and recognition, the time complexity is critical. We propose a solution with very low time complexity and competitive accuracy for the computation of dense optical flow. It consists of three parts: (1) inverse search for patch correspondences; (2) dense displacement field creation through patch aggregation along multiple scales; (3) variational refinement. At the core of our Dense Inverse Search-based method (DIS) is the efficient search of correspondences inspired by the inverse compositional image alignment proposed by Baker and Matthews (2001, 2004). DIS is competitive on standard optical flow benchmarks. DIS runs at 300 Hz up to 600 Hz on a single CPU core (1024                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}                                                                  {\texttimes}                                                             436 resolution. 42 Hz/46 Hz when including preprocessing: disk access, image re-scaling, gradient computation.

In order to allow for large displacements, linearisations in the two data terms are strictly avoided. We present a consistent numerical scheme based on two nested fixed point iterations. By proving that this scheme implements a coarse-to-fine warping strategy, we give a theoretical foundation for warping which has been used on a mainly experimental basis so far. Our evaluation demonstrates that the novel method gives significantly smaller angular errors than previous techniques for optical flow estimation. We show that it is fairly insensitive to parameter variations, and we demonstrate its excellent robustness under noise.",

abstract="The problem of road or lane perception is a crucial enabler for advanced driver assistance systems. As such, it has been an active field of research for the past two decades with considerable progress made in the past few years. The problem was confronted under various scenarios, with different task definitions, leading to usage of diverse sensing modalities and approaches. In this paper we survey the approaches and the algorithmic techniques devised for the various modalities over the last 5 years. We present a generic break down of the problem into its functional building blocks and elaborate the wide range of proposed methods within this scheme. For each functional block, we describe the possible implementations suggested and analyze their underlying assumptions. While impressive advancements were demonstrated at limited scenarios, inspection into the needs of next generation systems reveals significant gaps. We identify these gaps and suggest research directions that may bridge them.",

	abstract="The Hough Transform is a well-known method for detecting parameterized objects. It is the de facto standard for detecting lines and circles in 2-dimensional data sets. For 3D it has attained little attention so far. Even for the 2D case high computational costs have lead to the development of numerous variations for the Hough Transform. In this article we evaluate different variants of the Hough Transform with respect to their applicability to detect planes in 3D point clouds reliably. Apart from computational costs, the main problem is the representation of the accumulator. Usual implementations favor geometrical objects with certain parameters due to uneven sampling of the parameter space. We present a novel approach to design the accumulator focusing on achieving the same size for each cell and compare it to existing designs.

	abstract = {In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes in unorganized point clouds.
	The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a
	set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points.
	Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For
	models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a
	representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even
	in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with
	respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data.
	Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute.
	Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include
	measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape
	classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering.}

	abstract = {The task of recovering three-dimensional (3-D) geometry from two-dimensional views of a scene is called 3-D reconstruction. It is an extremely active research area in computer vision. There is a large body of 3-D reconstruction algorithms available in the literature. These algorithms are often designed to provide different tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and practicality. In addition, even the output of various algorithms can be quite different. For example, some algorithms only produce a sparse 3-D reconstruction while others are able to output a dense reconstruction. The selection of the appropriate 3-D reconstruction algorithm relies heavily on the intended application as well as the available resources. The goal of this paper is to review some of the commonly used motion-parallax-based 3-D reconstruction techniques and make clear the assumptions under which they are designed. To do so efficiently, we classify the reviewed reconstruction algorithms into two large categories depending on whether a prior calibration of the camera is required. Under each category, related algorithms are further grouped according to the common properties they share.},

The relevant equations are redundant, thus providing a test of the rigidity assumption. They involve, among other observable quantities, the components of shear of the retinal velocity field, suggesting that the visual system may possess specialized channels for computing these components.},

Our sole input are two video streams from a calibrated stereo rig on top of a car. From these streams, we estimate structure-from-motion (SfM) and scene geometry in real-time. In parallel, we perform multi-view/multi-category object recognition to detect cars and pedestrians in both camera images. Using the SfM self-localization, 2D object detections are converted to 3D observations, which are accumulated in a world coordinate frame. A subsequent tracking module analyzes the resulting 3D observations to find physically plausible spacetime trajectories. Finally, a global optimization criterion takes object-object interactions into account to arrive at accurate 3D localization and trajectory estimates for both cars and pedestrians. We demonstrate the performance of our integrated system on challenging real-world data showing car passages through crowded city areas.},

Motion vectors of certain lengths and directions are constrained to lie on the imaging surface at particular loci whose location and form depends solely on the 3D motion parameters. If optical flow fields or stereo disparity fields are considered, then equal vectors are shown to lie on conic sections. Similarly, for normal motion fields, equal vectors lie within regions whose boundaries also constitute conics. By studying various properties of these curves and regions and their relationships, a characterization of the structure of rigid motion fields is given. The goal of this paper is to introduce a concept underlying the global structure of image displacement fields. This concept gives rise to various constraints that could form the basis of algorithms for the recovery of visual information from multiple views.},

	abstract = {Presents a road obstacle detection method able to cope with uphill and downhill gradients and dynamic pitching of the vehicle.

The advantage of this image is that it provides semi-global matching and is able to perform robust obstacle detection even in the case of partial occlusion or errors committed during the matching process. Furthermore, this detection is performed without any explicit extraction of coherent structures. This paper explains the construction of the "v-disparity" image, its main properties, and the obstacle detection method. The longitudinal profile of the road is estimated and the objects located above the road surface are then extracted as potential obstacles; subsequently, the accurate detection of road obstacles, in particular the position of tyre-road contact points is computed in a precise manner. The whole process is performed at frame rate with a current-day PC. Our experimental findings and comparisons with the results obtained using a flat geometry hypothesis show the benefits of our approach.},

This letter presents a well-integrated framework for free space estimation in this challenge. Our approach couples an improved V-disparity with a proposed confidence map in a probabilistic fashion. The improved V-disparity representation adopts the sliding windows paradigm and a new V-disparity filter is designed. The proposed confidence map represents the ownership of pixels like occupancy grids, but is built only using the information of the disparity map. The free space estimation is implemented in the confidence map with the global optimization paradigm of dynamic programming. We demonstrate our superior performance compared to two other methods from the literature on a manually labeled dataset from KITTI's object detection benchmark.},

Within a framework of driver assistance applications, it is assumed that the 3D scene is a set of 3D planes. In this paper, the vision process considers obstacles, roads and buildings as planar structures. These planes are detected by exploiting iso-velocity curves after optical flow estimation. A Hough Transform-like frame called c-velocity was designed. This paper explains how this c-velocity, defined by analogy to the v-disparity in stereovision, can represent planes, regardless of their orientation and how this representation facilitates plane extraction. Under a translational camera motion, planar surfaces are transformed into specific parabolas of the c-velocity space. The error and robustness analysis of the proposed technique confirms that this cumulative approach is very efficient for making the detection more robust and coping with optical flow imprecision. Moreover, the results suggest that the concept could be generalized to the detection of other parameterized surfaces than planes.},

We show that point correspondences between three images, and the fundamental matrices computed from these point correspondences, are sufficient to recover the internal orientation of the camera (its calibration), the motion parameters, and to compute coherent perspective projection matrices which enable us to reconstruct 3-D structure up to a similarity. In contrast with other methods, no calibration object with a known 3-D shape is needed, and no limitations are put upon the unknown motions to be performed or the parameters to be recovered, as long as they define a projective camera. The theory of the method, which is based on the constraint that the observed points are part of a static scene, thus allowing us to link the intrinsic parameters and the fundamental matrix via the absolute conic, is first detailed.

	abstract = {There are two major approaches for estimating camera motion (egomotion) given an image sequence. Each approach has own strengths and weaknesses. One approach is the feature based methods. In this approach the point feature correspondences are taken as the input. Since initially the depths of point features are unknown, the egomotion is estimated by the depth independent epipolar constraints on the point feature correspondences. This approach is robust in practice, but is relatively limited in accuracy since it exploits no structure assumption, such as planarity. The other approach, termed the direct method, has the advantage in its accuracy. In this method, the egomotion is estimated as the parameters of a homography by directly aligning the planar potion of two images. The direct method may be preferable in the cases with known planes that are persistent in the view. The on-board camera system for ground vehicles is a representative example. Despite the potential accuracy, the direct method fails when the plane lacks proper texture. We propose an egomotion estimation method that is based on both the homographic constraint on a planar region, and on the epipolar constraint on generally non-planar regions, so that the both kinds of visual cues contribute to the estimation. We observe that the method improves the egomotion estimation in robustness while retaining the comparable accuracy to the direct method.},

	abstract = {Reliable scene analysis, under varying conditions, is an essential task in nearly any assistance or autonomous system application, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are no exception. ADAS commonly involve adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane change assistance, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance—with the ultimate goal of producing a fully autonomous vehicle. The present paper addresses detection and tracking of moving objects within the context of ADAS. We use a multisensor setup consisting of a radar and a stereo camera mounted on top of a vehicle. We propose to model the sensors uncertainty in polar coordinates on Lie Groups and perform the objects state filtering on Lie groups, specifically, on the product of two special Euclidean groups, i.e., SE ( 2 ) 2 . To this end, we derive the designed filter within the framework of the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups. We assert that the proposed approach results with more accurate uncertainty modeling, since used sensors exhibit contrasting measurement uncertainty characteristics and the predicted target motions result with banana-shaped uncertainty contours. We believe that accurate uncertainty modeling is an important ADAS topic, especially when safety applications are concerned. To solve the multitarget tracking problem, we use the joint integrated probabilistic data association filter and present necessary modifications in order to use it on Lie groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset collected with the described multisensor setup in urban traffic scenarios.},

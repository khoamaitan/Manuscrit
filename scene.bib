	doi = {10.1109/IVS.2010.5548117},
	abstract = {There are two major approaches for estimating camera motion (egomotion) given an image sequence. Each approach has own strengths and weaknesses. One approach is the feature based methods. In this approach the point feature correspondences are taken as the input. Since initially the depths of point features are unknown, the egomotion is estimated by the depth independent epipolar constraints on the point feature correspondences. This approach is robust in practice, but is relatively limited in accuracy since it exploits no structure assumption, such as planarity. The other approach, termed the direct method, has the advantage in its accuracy. In this method, the egomotion is estimated as the parameters of a homography by directly aligning the planar potion of two images. The direct method may be preferable in the cases with known planes that are persistent in the view. The on-board camera system for ground vehicles is a representative example. Despite the potential accuracy, the direct method fails when the plane lacks proper texture. We propose an egomotion estimation method that is based on both the homographic constraint on a planar region, and on the epipolar constraint on generally non-planar regions, so that the both kinds of visual cues contribute to the estimation. We observe that the method improves the egomotion estimation in robustness while retaining the comparable accuracy to the direct method.},

	abstract = {Reliable scene analysis, under varying conditions, is an essential task in nearly any assistance or autonomous system application, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are no exception. ADAS commonly involve adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane change assistance, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance—with the ultimate goal of producing a fully autonomous vehicle. The present paper addresses detection and tracking of moving objects within the context of ADAS. We use a multisensor setup consisting of a radar and a stereo camera mounted on top of a vehicle. We propose to model the sensors uncertainty in polar coordinates on Lie Groups and perform the objects state filtering on Lie groups, specifically, on the product of two special Euclidean groups, i.e., SE ( 2 ) 2 . To this end, we derive the designed filter within the framework of the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups. We assert that the proposed approach results with more accurate uncertainty modeling, since used sensors exhibit contrasting measurement uncertainty characteristics and the predicted target motions result with banana-shaped uncertainty contours. We believe that accurate uncertainty modeling is an important ADAS topic, especially when safety applications are concerned. To solve the multitarget tracking problem, we use the joint integrated probabilistic data association filter and present necessary modifications in order to use it on Lie groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset collected with the described multisensor setup in urban traffic scenarios.},
